Play recorded bongo lectures faster.

//place recorded_bongo_lecture_URL on line 93 of data_extractor.py

The online lecture has some issues: <br/>
-lag/buffering time when jumping to a different part of the video <br/>
-no way to watch the lecture faster(ex: 1.25x speed) <br/>
Plus, when your spotty internet invariably cuts out, you can't watch anymore.

This program will create an mp4, given the url of a recorded bongo lecture. <br/>
in the mp4, the presentation slides remain synchronized with the audio. <br/>
you can then open the mp4 and watch at whatever speed you want, whenever you want. <br/>
